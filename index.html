      <h2>Here about my education</h2>
      <p>So, first of all, I am a graduate of secondary school â„–3 in Slonim.
        At school I studied well, although special thrust to study was not tested,
        but supervision and reminders to parents to make the lessons worked perfectly. <br>
        Then University. I am studying at BSEU and am very happy about it.
        In the first semester freedom made itself felt in connection with what exams
        I passed in my opinion quite bad. In the second semester and further the situation has changed.
        There was a motivation to learn and as a result I am one of the best in the group.</p>
